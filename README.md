# Payroll-Management-System
This payroll system is an important tool, but it is also a software-based system that is efficient. This will  include everything that has to do with the payment of the employee as well as other financial matters within the  organization. This scheme also includes tasks such as keeping track of salaries, recording hours  (including overtime and holidays), and making other deductions. It has been extremely successful to have this system in place to assist business owners in maintaining greater control over the payroll process
